# Hare-And-Tortoise-Computer-Graphics
In this Project, we are telling the same old child short story of hare and tortoise but graphically. The animation of the Hare and the Tortoise Race story is developed using OpenGL Library in C++.

Once there lived a hare and a tortoise in a jungle. The hare was very proud of his swiftness, but the tortoise walked slowly. The hare always taunted the tortoise for its slow pace. The tortoise with anger challenged the Hare for a race. The next day the race started from a particular place. They were to reach the bank of the river. The hare took a few leaps and was much ahead of the tortoise he looked back and saw that the tortoise was at a great distance. He decided to take a nap. But he slept for a long time. The tortoise had reached the goal. The hare ran very fast but the tortoise had already reached. The hare realized that slow and steady wins the race.

With the use of different functionality like of making polygons, using various functions of mouse and creation of menu , the whole story is plotted in this project. This project gives a user-friendly interface for the end user to interact with the frames. This project contains several different frames that are used in a particular sequence to help the user understand the story .
